            <p>Hello! I'm Sam Gallardo, a second-year college student who loves working with technology and art. I love to grab my notebook, put on some music, and sketch!</p>

            <h3>What music genres do I listen to?</h3>
            <p>I’ve never had to organize the music I listen to, so this was quite a challenge for me. I don’t have any applications that record the type of music I listen to, like Spotify, so it was interesting to pinpoint my top ten songs. I will say, it’s very difficult to narrow down the options, but I think I have a general idea of the top three genres I listen to.</p>
            <p> I won’t go into specific subgenres, but three of the genres I listen to the most are EDM, Kpop, and Rock! I found that some of these songs overlap genres, while others have their own signature sound. </p>

            <h3>EDM</h3>
            <p>EDM is the oldest genre of music that I listen to, I discovered it in about sixth grade, about 7-8 years ago. While I don’t listen to sole instrumentals that often now, the backtracks of many of these songs are EDM related. I would say I’m an upbeat person, so EDM helps give me that kick while doing my tasks for the day. However, I can’t play EDM everywhere because sometimes the location isn’t right. A good example is listening to EDM while I’m in slow traffic. It doesn’t really fit and may sound aggravating at times. </p>

        <section>
            <h3>KPOP</h3>
            <p>I discovered Kpop in high school and made a lot of friends who introduced me to a lot of the groups I know today. Keep in mind not all kpop songs are super upbeat. However, I like the upbeat tracks slightly more than the mellow songs. Because I don't understand the language as much, I find it less distracting while doing my work. Some Kpop instrumentals overlap with EDM, but fit under the “Noise” category of Kpop. I will say, after listening to some tracks over and over, I've probably memorized the lyrics to many songs.</p>

            <h3>ROCK</h3>
            <p>I listen to different types of rock, and it’s what I normally put on when commuting to school in the morning. Most of my time has been listening to The Buzz (FM: 94.5). I did have a bit of a Metallica phase back in my junior year, but now I listen to a lot of Red Hot Chili Peppers music. I know there’s different types of Rock, and it would be wrong to generalize them under one category. However, I’m willing to listen to different types and I’m always willing to take new recommendations!</p>
