        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h2>Our Company Overview:</h2>
        <p>In 2010, ESSENTIA met Nick Conley, a Stanford PhD chemist. Together, we aspired to
            create a miracle formula that would treat your outside in, and inside out.
            More than a decade later, we’ve created a product line based on the best science
            available. An evolving range of synergistic topical formulas help treat your skin to
            enhance your natural beauty.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <h3>HOW WOULD A MOLECULAR BIOLOGIST TREAT SKIN DISEASE AND AGING?</h3>
            <p>After studying Molecular Biology in Norway, and after a stint working on cancer immunity project in Arizona (here’s a video of my white blood cells killing ovarian cancer), I joined a Silicon Valley startup to sequence DNA using electron microscopes.</p>
                <p>Throughout all of it, I had severe acne. From antibiotics to Accutane, I had tried everything. The only thing that had worked was a formula I found on eBay that an American chemist had made, It had some serious flaws, and then it disappeared from the market.</p>
                <p>I was left with two choices. Buy over-the-counter products that make vague claims, don’t list dosages of active ingredients, reference peer reviewed research and claim toxin-free sonic-jet-dispersed mango butter is the next big thing. Or go to a dermatologist for a formula that only deals with the symptoms of acne, that often come with serious side effects and don’t nurture the skin. Many pharmaceuticals are simply tweaked analogs of natural ingredients, created because they’re patentable – not because they work any better!</p>

            <h3>THE SOLUTION</h3>
            <p>In 2010, I met Nick Conley, a Stanford PhD chemist. Together, we created a better version of the miracle formula I found on eBay. After spending 4 years teaching myself cosmetic chemistry, I created a product line based on the best science available. An evolving range of synergistic topical formulas, which, combined with actionable lifestyle advice based on peer reviewed studies, help treat your skin outside in, and inside out.
            A max profit-margin of 40% ensures you're getting great value. We also reinvest &gt; of gross profits to make the best possible products, focusing on evolving a core set of multifunctional formulas instead of releasing a confusing array of them.</p>
