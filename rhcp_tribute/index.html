            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>The Red Hot Chili Peppers are an alternative rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1983. Their original members at the time consisted of vocalist Anthony Kiedis, bassist Flea, guitarist Hillel Slovak, and drummer Jack Irons.

            <p>They were first recognized by EMI/Capitol Records and released their first debut album "The Red Hot Chili Peppers" in 1984, but didn't rise to fame until the late 1980's. Their breakthrough album, "Blood Sugar Sex Magik" released in 1991 and became one of the most influential albums that took them to global fame. Some of their most popular tracks on their album are "Under the Bridge", "Give it Away", and "Suck my Kiss".</p>

            <p>Despite facing personal and professional challenges, including the tragic death of guitarist Hillel Slovak on June 25th, 1988, the Red Hot Chili Peppers continued to evolve their musical style. Their style eventually included a mixture of funk, punk, and rock elements that set standards for alternative rock at the time. After Hillel Slovak's passing, guitarist John Frusciante joined the group at the age of 18 in 1988, first appearing in the album "Mother's Milk" in 1989. He has played a crucial role in the bands success, contributing to acclaimed albums like "Californication" (1999) and "By the Way" (2002).</p>

            <p>In the following years, they released popular albums "Stadium Arcadium" (2006), "The Getaway" (2016), and recent album "Unlimited Love" (2022).
