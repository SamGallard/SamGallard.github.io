        <h1>~About Me~</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Sammy G, and I am a passionate digital artist with a love for bringing ideas to life through art. My journey into the art world began when I was about 9 years old, but started taking art seriously when I was in sixth grade (about 11 years old). I initially started drawing cars and buildings and then fell in love  drawing characters from my favorite series.</p>

        <p>While I was a traditional artist at first, I switched over to digital artwork around the time I turned 13. Over time, my curiosity and persistence led me to explore new digital tools, and I've never looked back. I've jumped through different art applications: Autodesk Sketchbook, Krita, FireAlpaca, Photoshop, illustrator, and now Clip Studio Paint.</p>

        <p>Today, I specialize in graphic design, character artwork, and I am always looking for new ways to push the boundaries of creativity. Whether it's a simple sketch or a detailed illustration, I want to capture emotion and the character's essence with every piece I create. Though I will admit, a lot of the time I take inspiration from the media I consume.</p>

        <p>Thank you for visiting my page. Feel free to explore my work and connect with me through Instagram!</p>
