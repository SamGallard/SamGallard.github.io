            <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
            
            <p>Hello! My name is Sam and I am a second year programming student. I made the switch to Computer Science from Graphic Design because I enjoy learning how to code a lot more than learn about art. While I still love making my own art and designing in my free time, I've always had an interest in STEM related courses. Lately I've really loved learning how to program; I could even say I've grown a passion for it!</p>
            <p> I also love to pick up new hobbies whenever I can, and looks like my new hobby will be making websites in my free time. I'm not too great at it right now, but I'm sure I'll see progress in a year or two. I see myself working with computers a lot more in the next couple of years!</p>

            <p>As far as my hobbies go, I work on a lot of digital art and graphic design projects in my free time. I draw a lot of video game characters.</p>

            <h3>My Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn more about software development</li>
                <li>Try out robotics</li>
                <li>Network with other STEM students in similar fields</li>
                <li>Continue Learning Code!</li>
            </ul>
